# Science Saturday 1

At some point during a happy hour at work, a few drinks in to be sure, someone mentioned that they had heard that it is not possible to tell the difference between red and white wine if they are both served at room temperature. "Bullshit!", someone probably said. "There's tannins and shit." So, being the bright, drunk, ambitious scientists that we are, we set forth to investigate this and many other questions. Really, it was just an excuse for a bunch of people to get together on a Saturday and drink a bunch of wine. 

## Methodology

This test was a blinded test. Each person was given a blindfold (party time!). Each tester was given two samples of wine. The type of wine of the two samples was randomly selected, so any given pair could be comprised of a red and a white, two reds, or two whites. The guesser would then have to guess what type of wine they were drinking. They were also asked to rate the wines. The test was then repeated 10 times (for group A) and 11 times for (group B). 

## Results

### Question 1
The simplest analysis that can be done is to figure out what percentage of wines were guessed correctly, regardless of what color they were paired with. Some of the tests included Rose, but those have been excluded in this portion of the analysys. (The guessers were not told there would be a third type of wine, right?)

*Overall, 82.9% of wines were identified correctly.*

Broken down by type, red wine was guessed correctly 85.5% of the time, while white was guessed correctly 78.9% of the time. 

### Question 2
The next way to look at the information at hand is to
