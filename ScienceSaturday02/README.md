#### Summary
In this test we wanted to find out what the best shitty beer is. The idea is that sometimes you find yourself at a bar or party where there is only mass produced beers. We wanted to find out which beer you should be ordering by conducting a bling taste test.

#### Method
We had a total of 18 different beers (Table 1). The beers were placed in clear pitchers labeled with only a letter. Drinkers were given a score sheet where they could rate each beer in a 1-5 scale. The drinkers were free to try each beer in whichever order they preferred, but were asked to write down the order. 

#### Results

`mean_scores.py` plots the mean scores. 

`Individual_scores.ipynb` contains the the scores by individual. Because this is an interactive plot, it needs to be run in a Jupyter notebook.

`InitialBeer.ipynb` makes a box plot of the results. Because this is an interactive plot, it needs to be run in a Jupyter notebook.
