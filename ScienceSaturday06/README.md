- Date: 
- Location: Remington Row Party Room
- Participants: Anderson, Chris, Dzhuliya, Elaine, Emily, Heather, Jessica, Jo, Jon, Keira, Matt B., Rachel, Roberto

## Introduction

We wanted to explore the parameters that make a chocolate cookie good.

## Method

### Recipes

We started with a base recipe, ----------, which was then modified one ingredient at a time to see how that affected the cookie. 

- All brown sugar
- 1 egg, 1c. milk & extra flour
- Store-bought Tollhouse Dough
- Alton Brown
- Walnuts
- Cake flour & b. powder; no b. soda
- All white sugar
- Salted Butter
- All shortening
- Chilled Dough
- Mini chocolate chips
- Cocoa Powder
- Betty Crocker
- Chunks
- Extra flour
- Classic Tollhouse
- 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter
- Melted Butter

It would be difficult for one person to make all the varieties we tested, and therefore Each participant was in charge of baking one of the cookie variations. This introduced the uncontrolled parameter that each cookie was baked in a different oven. There was an attempt to control the size of the cookies, but this was also difficult to control and the cookie variations differed in size. 

### Tasting
