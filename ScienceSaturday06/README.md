# Science Saturday 6 - What's in a cookie?

- Date: Saturday, October 19, 2019 at 6:30 PM EDT – 10:30 PM EDT
- Location: Remington Row Party Room
- Participants: Anderson, Chris, Dzhuliya, Elaine, Emily, Heather, Jessica, Jo, Jon, Keira, Matt B., Rachel, Roberto

## Introduction

We wanted to explore the parameters that make a chocolate chip cookie good.

## Method

#### Baking
Instructions given to everyone:
* Cookies should follow the same basic recipe (Tollhouse) and not deviate from them except for the specified change.
* Please bake the cookies at least 2 hours before the event, but no more than 1-1.5 days before the event. We all know warm cookies are far superior, so no warm cookies will be allowed. Store in a container if making the day before to try and preserve them as best we can.
If we can stick to the same brands, that will take away some bias, but if you have an excess amount of one thing already, don't worry about it. These are selected using easy-to-find brands in Baltimore, MD.
* Flour: King Arthur All Purpose.
* Domino white sugar and light brown sugar.
* Land-o-lakes UNSALTED! butter.
* Crisco vegetable shortening (when used).
* Nestle tollhouse SEMI-SWEET chocolate chips.
* Large eggs.
* Salt should be fine grain, not sea salt, etc.
* All cookies should be about 1 inch balls when placed on cookie sheet -- don't over-crowd!
* Unless making the nuts recipe, don't add the nuts in the recipes.
* Weigh ingredients if you can (rather than using a measuring cup)
* Soften your butter for at least an hour maybe even 2 before baking. Don’t microwave it to soften it since that will melt part of it.
* Making a full batch so that we don't mess up our measurements.

A survey showed that of our sample, 5 people mixed their dough by hand, 3 with the paddle attachment, and 2 with a hand mixer and whisk attachment. This is an area for another science saturday getting to baking methods and mixing methods, but worth noting here still.

#### Testing
* In standard Science Saturday fashion, everyone was assigned a buddy to serve cookies and track scores.
* The order the cookies were eaten in was randomly assigned, so no one ate the cookies in the same order.
* All participants were blindfolded while tasting the cookies.
* Everyone could eat as much or as little of a cookie as they wanted to score the different parameters. Most people ended up eating about half of a cookie, although some people would only take one bite which might have highly biased the chocolatey and sweetness results.
* People were allowed to talk and give there numbers (rather than holding up fingers) because there were so many parameters we were judging and all of the orders were random, and everyone eating was blindfolded.

### Recipes

We started with a base recipe, [Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies by Michael Chu](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/185/Nestle-Toll-House-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies), which was then modified one ingredient at a time to see how that affected the cookie. This recipe turns the classic tollhouse recipe (found on the back of the chocolate chips) into weights. For those who didn't have a scale, the classic recipe with US measurements was used.

- All brown sugar (Elaine)
  - 1 1/2 c. packed brown sugar. 0 c. granulated sugar (325g brown sugar, 0 g white)
- 1 egg, 1c. milk instead of 2 eggs (Dzhuliya -- more flour was added accidentally, but was kept in test)
  - Beat egg, milk, and sugars together.
- Store-bought Tollhouse Dough (Emily)
- Alton Brown (Heather & Jon -- used standard cookie scoop, so were larger than 1" balls; a much better size)
  - [Alton Brown](https://altonbrown.com/the-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/)
- Adding Walnuts (Rachel)
  - Add walnuts in addition to the chips
- Cake flour & b. powder; no b. soda (Heather & Jon -- used standard cookie scoop, so were larger than 1" balls; a much better size)
  - Cake flour along with 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of 1 teaspoon baking soda
- All white sugar (Anderson)
  - 1 1/2c. granulated sugar. 0c. brown sugar (300g white, 0g brown)
- Salted butter instead of unsalted (Matt B.)
- All shortening instead of butter (Keira)
  - 1 c. shortening instead of butter. (room temp)
- Chilled Dough ~1hr (Chris)
  - After mixing, chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
- Mini chocolate chips (Rachel)
- Cocoa Powder (Rachel)
  - 1/2 cup of cocoa powder (~42g)
- Betty Crocker (Rachel)
  - Recipe from 1935(?) cookbook
- Chocolate Chunks instead of chips (Miranda)
  - Chopped chocolate chunks instead of chips
- Extra flour (Roberto)
  - Add 1/4 cup more flour (~33 more grams)
- Classic Tollhouse (Rachel)
- 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter (Rachel)
  - 0.5c. shortening and 0.5c. room temp butter
- Melted Butter (Jo)
  - Melt butter before adding to sugars. Cool slightly.

It would be difficult for one person to make all the varieties we tested, and therefore Each participant was in charge of baking one of the cookie variations. This introduced the uncontrolled parameter that each cookie was baked in a different oven. There was an attempt to control the size of the cookies, but this was also difficult to control and the cookie variations differed in size.

### Tasting

During the tasting, blindfolds were used while eating the cookies. Each cookie variation was evaluated based on the below parameters.

  * Bite Key
    * 1 Very Crunchy
    * 2 Crunchy
    * 3 Chewy
    * 4 Cakey
  * Chococlate Key
    * 1 Not Choc.
    * 2 Choc.
    * 3 Too (Very) Choc.
  * Moist Key
    * 1 Dry
    * 2 Neutral
    * 3 Moist
  * Sweet Key
    * 1 Not Sweet
    * 2 Sweet
    * 3 Super Sweet
  * Personal Key
    * 0 coffin emoji
    * 1 throwing up emoji
    * 2 sweat sad face emoji
    * 3 shrug emoji
    * 4 drool emoji
    * 5 head exploding emoji
  * Appearance key
    * 1 Probably not
    * 2 Would eat
    * 3 Martha Stewart level
