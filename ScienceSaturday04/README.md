#### Introduction

We wanted to find out what the best chain pizza is.  

#### Method

We divided the tests by two types of pizza, cheese and pepperoni. All the pizzas were hand-tossed crust. The Tasters were blindfolded and fed half slices of pizza. They were asked to rate several aspects of the pizzas on a scale of 1 to 5:

1. Sauce
2. Cheese
3. Topping
4. Greassiness (5 being the most greasy)
5. Crust
6. Overall

To attempt to maintain freshness as much as possible, the pizzas were kept warm in an oven. The temperature of the pizzas was measured (using food thermometers) and recorded immediately before serving. 

#### Results

Running `pizza_results.py` will make the following plots:

1. Overall cheese results
2. Overall pepperoni results
3. Cheese vs temperature plot
4. Pepperoni vs temperature plot
